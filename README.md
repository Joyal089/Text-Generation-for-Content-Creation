Explain the importance of AI in modern technology.

The last point was made by a young researcher from Australia who worked on Deep Learning, which is an artificial intelligence research project funded by Microsoft and Intel for their Windows 8 operating system that uses machine learning to solve real-world problems such as information security or financial transactions (see video below). He mentioned how this could be used with other technologies including robots â€“ like those being developed at Google's Home Lab where they will make money using algorithms instead when it comes timelling them out over long distances rather than relying solely upon human input: "We're not only building machines but we are also getting smarter about what our users want us [to do]." The future has already seen big advances towards automation coming into use thanks largely due mostly to advancements through open source software development techniques called 'clusters', whereby crowdsourced data can then interact directly between humans so far away within existing systems without any need per se - making these new methods more likely to benefit consumers if deployed successfully across multiple platforms/clouds."

Note the sentence change each time you run the code and does it gives actual valid information is still debatable
